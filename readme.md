## What is it for?

Editing files on your local machine.

If you're passingly familiar with Sublime or VSCode the keyboard bindings should feel like home. 

### Key features: 
- it's super light-weight
- it's 95% offline capable
- It supports a wide range of code files
- has tabbed editing
- common find/Regex Find/goto line
- comment toggling
- multi-cursor support
- multiple themes (not persistent between visits, yet)

>**Please Note**  
> Only works in chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera) - turns out Brave disable the File System API, and Firefox and Safari have not implemented

This app works _exclusively_ with local file editing, __*NOTHING*__ leaves your computer, __*EVER*__. Remote filesystems _should_ work, so long as your system's file explorer can access it, Code can access it... hypothically. I've used it on Windows 10, Chrome OS and Linux.

## What is it _not_ for?
- Storing your documents online (see above).
- Serving extremely specific needs of others with no utility to me.
    - You can make suggestions, and they may be implemented, but the repository owner reserves the right to veto.
