# Code

## What is it for?

Editing files on your local machine. 

If you're passingly familiar with Sublime or VSCode the keyboard bindings should feel like home. 

### Key features: 
- it's super light-weight
- it's 99% offline capable 
-- (the 1% is any themes / modes not already loaded will not be available offline)
- It supports over 100 coding languages
- has tabbed editing
- common find/Regex Find/goto line
- comment toggling
- code folding
- full multi-cursor support
- many colour themes
- dark mode

>**Please Note**  
> Only works in desktop, chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera) - turns out Brave disables the File System API, Firefox and Safari have not (and may never) implement, and AFAIK no mobile browsers support it.

The app works _exclusively_ with local file editing, your files don't leave your computer, __*EVER*__. Remote filesystems _should_ work -- so long as your system's file explorer can access it, Code can access it... hypothically -- I've used and tested it on Windows 10, Chrome OS and Ubuntu Linux.

## What is it _not_ for?
- Storing your documents online (see above).
- Serving extremely specific needs of others with no utility to me.
    - You can make suggestions, and they may be implemented, but the repository owner reserves the right to veto.

## Where can I try it?
For now a working copy of Code is hosted at https://code.jakbox.dev/

Of course you can alway clone the repo, it includes node+express app to host PWA and run/install it from local host.

## I have other questions
