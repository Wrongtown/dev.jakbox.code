## What is it for?

Editing files on your local machine.

If you're passingly familiar with Sublime or VSCode the keyboard bindings should feel like home. 

### Key features: 
- it's super light-weight
- it's 99% offline capable 
-- (the 1% is any themes / modes not already loaded will not be available offline)
- It supports over 100 coding languages
- has tabbed editing
- common find/Regex Find/goto line
- comment toggling
- code folding
- full multi-cursor support
- many colour themes
- dark mode

>**Please Note**  
> Only works in desktop, chromium-based, browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera) - turns out Brave disable the File System API, and Firefox and Safari have not implemented, and the Chrome Android team current does not plan to implement support either.

This app works _exclusively_ with local file editing, __*NOTHING*__ leaves your computer, __*EVER*__. Remote filesystems _should_ work, so long as your system's file explorer can access it, Code can access it... hypothically. I've used it on Windows 10, Chrome OS and Linux.

## What is it _not_ for?
- Storing your documents online (see above).
- Serving extremely specific needs of others with no utility to me.
    - You can make suggestions, and they may be implemented, but the repository owner reserves the right to veto.
